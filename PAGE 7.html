<p>otherwise undesirable behaviour. Instant messaging: a real-time Internet 
communications service that notifies you when one or more people are online and 
then allows you to exchange messages or files or join a private chat room with 
them. To use IM you install software from an instant messaging service, 
sometimes called an instant messenger (ICQ, Skype, AIM, MSN, Jabber, ...). 
Instant messaging is by far the most common form of communication in recent 
times, it can (exchange text, voice, video). Newsgroups: A newsgroup is an 
online area in which users conduct written discussion about a particular 
subject. To participate in a discussion, a user sends a message to the news 
group, and other users in the newsgroup read and reply to the message. IRC 
(Internet Relay Chat) e.g. This service allows the Internet to one or more of 
Internet users who are hooked to the same channel at the same time see the text 
that you type on your computer, and the texts of other active users typing on 
his computer. Voice / Video Communication - Skype Social networks e.g. 
LinkedIn', 'Myspace', 'Tumblr', „Instagram, TWITTER, BLOG Search Engines i.e. 
Apple, google, yahoo, bingo, e.t.c Web-Hosting (DATACENTER) E-MAIL (Electronic 
Mail) This is the transfer of electronic messages from one geographical location 
to another using computers and computer related computerized devices. Some 
websites such as MSN Hotmail, G-mail and Yahoo, provide free email services, to 
use these web-based email programs, you connect to the website and set up an 
e-mail account which typically include an e-mail address and a password.</p>

<p>·: This is a unique combination of 
characters, such as letters of alphabets or numbers that identifies a specific 
user Domain name: This is the name of the search engine, website e.g. yahoo, 
hotmail, my way Top level: This indicates the purpose of the organization which 
the computer sometimes has no part e.g. com, org. Advantages of e-mail 
communication over an ordinary mail Qn: Mention the advantages of using email as 
a means of communication Email has many advantages over both ordinary mail and 
the telephone for example: </p>
<p>· A message can be sent anywhere in the world at the price call without 
having to leave your desk. </p>
<p>· Speed of delivery: The message will arrive in a few minutes: can be picked 
up the next time the recipient looks at their e-mail. </p>
<p>· Ability to send to multiple recipients: the message can be sent to a group 
of people. </p>
<p>· It is very easy to send a reply to an email as soon as it is receive using 
the reply button. </p>
<p>· Large files such as spreadsheets and graphics can be sent attachments.</p>
<p>· Low costs: an email is very cheap. · E-mail is universal while ordinary 
mail one has to change address wherever he/she is located. </p>
<p>· Free mail like sports can be subscribed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;· You can send multimedia like Music, Videos · Assurance of whether the 
mail has been delivered or not. </p>
<p>· Easy to use. Emails applications have user friendly tools that help during 
composing messages. ·</p>
<p>&nbsp;Easy to prioritize: Since the mails have subject lines, it is easy to 
prioritize them and ignore unwanted mails. </p>
<p class="auto-style1">4 1 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</p>
<p>&nbsp;· Emails can also carry hyperlinks that lead to other Webpages with 
just a click.&nbsp; One can subscribe to news and other online services through 
email . Email software have management features that help users to organize 
their messages in folders like inbox, sent, draft, etc.&nbsp; Easier for 
reference: When one needs to reply to a mail, there is a provision in the 
mailing system to attach the previous mails as references. This refreshes the 
recipient's knowledge, on what he is reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;· Environment friendly: Postal mails use paper as a medium to send 
letters. Electronic mail thus, saves a lot of trees from being axed. It also 
saves fuel needed in transportation. · Email software has a good degree of 
security features such as username and password before sign in · Email 
applications have inbuilt English dictionary which safeguards the sender from 
incorrect spelling and grammar.&nbsp; There is flexibility in time of opening 
the e-mail for any time access. At any time of the day or night, one can 
communicate with friends, relatives, professors and business associates. 
Messages remain permanent for future and frequent accessing from anywhere. </p>
<p>· Use of graphics such as colorful greeting cards and interesting pictures 
can be sent through e-mails. · Advertising tool: many individuals and companies 
are using e-mails to advertise their products, services, etc. Disadvantages / 
limitation Outline the limitations of using Email as means of communication.&nbsp; 
Emails can carry Viruses: The recipient needs to scan the mails, as viruses are 
transmitted through them and have the potential to harm computer systems.&nbsp; 
Spam and Junk: E-mails when used to send unsolicited messages and unwanted 
advertisements create nuisance called Spam. Checking and deleting these unwanted 
mails can unnecessarily consume a lot of time, and it has become necessary to 
block or filter the unwanted e-mails by means of spam filters. E-mail spoofing 
is another common practice. Spoofing involves deceiving the recipient by 
altering the e-mail headers or the addresses from which the mail is sent.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;4 2 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</p>
<p>&nbsp;· Hacking and email interception: The act of unauthorized attempts to 
bypass the security mechanisms of an information system or network is termed as 
hacking. After the e-mail is sent and before it is received by the desired 
recipient, it "bounces" between servers located in different parts of the world. 
Hence, the e-mail can be intercepted by a professional hacker. </p>
<p>· Misinterpretation: One has to be careful while posting any kind of content 
through an e-mail. If typed in a hurry, the matter could be misinterpreted.&nbsp; 
Since the content posted via e-mails is considered informal, there is a chance 
of business documents going unnoticed. Thus, urgent transactions and especially 
those requiring signatures are not managed through e - mails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;· Crowded inbox: Over a period of time, the e-mail inbox may get 
crowded with mails. It becomes difficult for the user to manage such a huge 
chunk of mails. </p>
<p>· Need to check the inbox regularly: In order to be updated, one has to check 
his e-mail account regularly, which may be expensive in the long run. </p>
<p>· Email cannot be used without computers especially in remote areas without 
electricity · In case one forgets his/her password, signing in is not possible 
and this can lead to loss of information. Email may violate privacy in case 
someone else gets to know your user password since the other may check your 
mails. What is needed to connect the internet and World Wide Web? The basic 
requirements are</p>

can have readily available help for homework. News, of all kinds is available 
almost instantaneously. Commentary, on that news, from every conceivable 
viewpoint is also available </p>
<p class="auto-style1">4 4 | ©ULTRA TECH 2024</p>
<p>&nbsp;Disadvantages of internet:&nbsp; Virus Threat: Internet users are often 
plagued by virus attacks on their systems. Virus programs are inconspicuous and 
may get activated if you click a seemingly harmless link. </p>
<p>· There is a lot of wrong information on the internet. Anyone can post 
anything, and much of it is garbage.&nbsp; There are predators that hang out on 
the internet waiting to get unsuspecting people in dangerous situations.&nbsp; 
Some people are getting addicted to the internet and thus causing problems with 
their interactions of friends and loved ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;· Pornography that can get in the hands of young children too easily.&nbsp; 
Easy to waste a lot of time on the internet. You can start surfing, and then 
realize far more time has passed than you realized. Internet and television 
together of added to the more sedentary lifestyles of people which further 
exacerbate the obesity problem.&nbsp; Internet has a lot of "cheater" sites. 
People can buy essays and pass them off as their own far more easily than they 
used to be able to do. </p>
<p>· There are a lot of unscrupulous businesses that have sprung up on the 
internet to take advantage of people. · Hackers can create viruses that can get 
into your personal computer and ruin valuable data. </p>
<p>· Hackers can use the internet for identity theft.&nbsp; It can be quite 
depressing to be on the internet and realize just how uneducated so many people 
have become in today's society. Internet service providers Is large

with a graphical user interface for displaying HTML files, used to navigate the 
World Wide Web? A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software 
application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on 
the World Wide Web. Or A web browser is application software that allows users 
to view or access web pages. An information resource is identified by a Uniform 
Resource Identifier (URI/URL) and may be a web page, image, video or other piece 
of content To browse the web, you need a computer that is connected to the 
internet and that has a web browser. With the internet connection established, 
you can use the mouse to start a web browser. The browser retrieves and displays 
a starts page, times called the browser's home page. The initial page that is 
displayed is the one that is selected by your web browser. Home page: This is 
the first page that a website displays (similar to a book cover or table of 
content) Examples of web browsers. The more widely used web browsers are:

<p>&nbsp;sending attachments or merging different versions.) Cloud computing 
consists of hardware and software resources made available on the Internet as 
managed third-party services. These services typically provide access to 
advanced software applications and high-end networks of server computers. Types 
of Cloud Computing Service providers create cloud computing systems to serve 
common business or research needs. Examples of cloud computing services include: 
virtual IT - configure and utilize remote, third-party servers as extensions to 
a company's local IT network software - utilize commercial software 
applications, or develop and remotely host custom built applications Network 
storage - back up or archive data across the Internet to a provider without 
needing to know the physical location of storage. Cloud computing systems all 
generally are designed for scalability to support large numbers of customers and 
surges in demand. Examples of Cloud Computing Services These examples illustrate 
the different types of cloud computing services available today: Amazon EC2 - 
virtual IT Google App Engine - application hosting Google Apps - software as a 
service Apple MobileMe - network storage Some providers offer cloud computing 
services for free while others require a paid subscription. Cloud Computing Pros 
and Cons Service providers are responsible for installing and maintaining core 
technology within the cloud. Some customers prefer this model because it limits 
their own manageability burden. However, customers cannot directly control 
system stability in this model and are highly dependent on the provider instead. 
Cloud computing systems are normally designed to closely track all system 
resources, which enables providers to charge customers according to the 
resources each consumes. Some customers will prefer this so-called metered 
billing approach to save money, while others will prefer a flat-rate 
subscription to ensure predictable monthly or yearly costs. Using a cloud 
computing environment generally requires you to send data over the Internet and 
store it on a third-party system. The privacy and security risks associated with 
this model must be weighed against alternatives. </p>

<p>&nbsp;COMPUTER ETHICS AND SOCIETY</p>
<p>. Definition of Computer Ethics Ethics are a set of moral principles that 
govern an individual or a group on what is acceptable behaviour while using a 
computer. Computer ethics is a set of moral principles that govern the usage of 
computers and computer systems. One of the common issues of computer ethics is 
violation of copyright issues. Duplicating copyrighted content without the 
author"s approval, accessing personal information of others are some of the 
examples that violate ethical principles. What is an IT code of conduct? These 
are written guideline that helps determine whether computer action is ethical, 
Employers can distribute to employees. Internet Ethics for everyone Internet 
ethics means acceptable behavior for using internet. We should be honest, 
respect the rights and property of others on the internet. Netiquette, 
Netiquette, or net etiquette, refers to etiquette on the Internet. Good 
netiquette involves respecting others' privacy and not doing anything online 
that will annoy or frustrate other people. Three areas where good netiquette is 
highly stressed are e-mail, online chat, and newsgroups. For example, people 
that spam other users with unwanted e-mails or flood them with messages have 
very bad netiquette. You don't want to be one of those people. If you're new to 
a newsgroup or online chat room, it may help to observe how people communicate 
with each other before jumping in Acceptance One has to accept that Internet is 
not a value free-zone .It means World Wide Web is a place where values are 
considered in the broadest sense so we must take care while shaping content and 
services and we should recognize that internet is not apart from universal 
society but it is a primary component of it. Sensitivity to National and Local 
cultures It belongs to all and there is no barrier of national and local 
cultures. It cannot be subject to one set of values like the local TV channel or 
the local newspaper we have to accommodate multiplicity of usage. While using 
e-Mail and chatting Internet must be used for communication with family and 
friends. Avoid chatting with strangers and</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span class="auto-style1">5 0 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;forwarding e-mails from unknown people /strangers. We must be aware of 
risks involved in chatting and forwarding e-mails to strangers. Pretending to be 
someone else We must not use internet to fool others by pretending to be someone 
else. Hiding our own identity to fool others in the Internet world is a crime 
and may also be a risk to others. Avoid Bad language We must not use rude or bad 
language while using e-Mail, chatting, blogging and social networking; We need 
to respect their views and should not criticize anyone on the internet. Hide 
personal information We should not give personal details like home address, 
phone numbers, interests, passwords. No photographs should be sent to strangers 
because it might be misused and shared with others without their knowledge. 
While Downloading Internet is used to listen and learn about music, It is also 
used to watch videos and play games we must not use it to download them or share 
copyrighted material. We must be aware of the importance of copyrights and 
issues of copyright. Access to Internet The internet is a time-efficient tool 
for everyone that enlarges the possibilities for curriculum growth. Learning 
depends on the ability to find relevant and reliable information quickly and 
easily, and to select, understand and assess that information. Searching for 
information on the internet can help to develop these skills. Classroom 
exercises and take - home assessment tasks, where students are required to 
compare website content, are ideal for alerting students to the requirements of 
writing for different audiences, the purpose of particular content, identifying 
and judging accuracy and reliability. Since many sites adopt particular views 
about issues, the internet is a useful tool for developing the skills of 
distinguishing fact from opinion and exploring subjectivity and objectivity.

<p>&nbsp;COMPUTER NETWORK This is a connection of two or more computers via a 
communication media to share resources. E.g. a group of computers can be sharing 
a printer. A computer network is a system in which multiple computers are 
connected to each other to share information and resources. Types of computer 
networks There are three types of computer networks namely:- Local Area Network 
(LAN) This is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited 
geographical area such as a home, school computer lab, Office Building 
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) Is a high-speed network that connects local area 
networks in a metropolitan area e.g. a city or town. Wide Area Network (WAN) Is 
a Network that covers a large geographical area (such as a city, country or the 
world) using a communication channel. Wireless Local Area Network - a LAN based 
on WiFi wireless network technology Advantages of Networking over stand-alone 
computers&nbsp; Facilitates communication: Using a network, people communicate 
efficiently and easily via email, Instant&nbsp; messaging, chat rooms e.tc </p>
<p>· Sharing hard ware: In a networked environment, each computer on the network 
has access to hardware on the network e.g. Printers, scanners e. t. c. </p>
<p>· Data and Information sharing: In a networked environment any authorized 
computer user can access data and Information stored on computers on the 
network. </p>
<p>· Sharing software: Users connected to a network has access to software on 
the network. To support multiple users access of software most Venders sell 
network version or site licenses of their software.</p>
