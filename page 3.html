INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Definition: ICT (information and communications technology 
- or technologies) is a term that includes any communication device or 
application, encompassing: radio, television, cellular phones, computer and 
network hardware and software, satellite systems and so on, as well as the 
various services and applications associated with them, such as 
videoconferencing and distance learning. ICTs are often spoken of in a 
particular context, such as ICTs in education, health care, or libraries. Or ICT 
stands for Information and Communication Technology and are defined as a set of 
technological tools and resources used to communicate, create, disseminate, 
store and manage information. These tools include computers, the internet, 
broadcasting (radio and Television) The importance of ICTs lies less in the 
technology itself than in its ability to create greater access to information 
and communication in underserved populations. Many countries around the world 
have established organizations for the promotion of ICTs, because it is feared 
that unless less technologically advanced areas have a chance to catch up, the 
increasing technological advances in developed nations will only serve to 
exacerbate the already-existing economic gap between technological "have" and 
"have not" areas. Internationally, the United Nations actively promotes ICTs for 
Development (ICT4D) as a means of bridging the digital divide. Digital divide is 
a term that refers to the gap between demographics and regions that have access 
to modern information and communications technology, and those that don't or 
have restricted access. This technology can include the telephone, television, 
personal computers and the Internet. INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS what is a 
computer? A computer is a general-purpose electronic machine that receives / 
accepts, processes, stores and output data into meaningful information A 
computer can also be defined as an electronic device operating under control of 
instructions stored in its own memory that can accept data, manipulate the data 
according to specified rules, produce results, and store the results for future 
use.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Characteristics of 
Computers. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Speed: The 
computers process data at an extremely fast rate, at millions or billions of 
instructions per second. A computer can perform a huge task in a few seconds 
that otherwise a normal human being may take days or even years to complete. The 
speed of a computer is calculated in MHz (Megahertz), that is, one million 
instructions per second.

<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">Ø</span></span> 
Accuracy: Besides the efficiency, the computers are also very accurate. The 
level of accuracy depends on the instructions and the type of machines being 
used. A computer in other wards does not make any mistakes. For example a 
computer can accurately give the result of division of any two numbers up to 10 
or more decimal places
<span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">
<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">Ø</span></span> 
Diligence: Computer, being a machine, does not suffer from the human traits of 
tiredness and lack of concentration. If four million calculations have to be 
performed, then the computer will perform the last, four-millionth calculation 
with the same accuracy and speed as the first calculation.
<span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">
<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">Ø</span></span> 
Reliability: Generally, reliability is the measurement of the performance of a 
computer, which is measured against some predetermined standard for operation 
without any failure.
<span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">
<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">Ø</span></span> 
Storage Capability: Computers can store large amounts of data and can recall the 
required information almost instantaneously i.e. data can be retrieved whenever 
required.
<span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">
<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">Ø</span></span> 
Versatility: Computers are quite versatile in nature. It can perform multiple 
tasks simultaneously with equal ease. For example, at one moment it can be used 
to draft a letter, another moment it can be used to play music and in between, 
one can print a document as well.
<span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">
<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">Ø</span></span> 
Resource Sharing: In the initial stages of development, computers used to be 
isolated machines. With the tremendous growth in computer technologies, 
computers today have the capability to connect with each other. This has made 
the sharing of costly resources like printers possible. Apart from device 
sharing, data and information can also be shared among groups of computers, thus 
creating a large information and knowledge base. Parts of a computer system A 
complete computer system comprises of four distinct parts.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>User Data and 
information Data is a collection of unprocessed items, which can include text 
numbers, images audio and video. Data is raw facts and figures by its self it 
doesn't provide anything meaningful. Information: Is processed data. It has 
meaning and is useful to one or more people. Information processing cycle a 
computer processes input (data) into output (information). Most people refer to 
the series of input, process, output and storage activities as the information 
processing cycle.

techniques used to capture, store, manipulate, communicate and use information. 
Fully exploiting the capability of ICT is of critical importance to the delivery 
of modern government and businesses in knowledge - driven economy Use of ICTs 
in; Education is the process of acquiring knowledge and skills, in the 
traditional model, people learn from others such as parents, teachers and 
employers. Many forms of printed materials such as books and manuals are used in 
learning. Today educators also are turning to ICT to assist with education. As 
the cost of computers and other ICT tools drops, many schools and companies can 
afford to equip labs and class rooms with computers. E- Learning
<span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">
<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">Ø</span></span> 
Sometimes the delivery of education occurs at a place while the learning occurs 
at other locations (distance learning). e.g. Students can take classes on web. 
More than 70% of colleges in developed countries offer some type of distance 
learning classes. A few even offer entire degrees online.
<span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">
<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">Ø</span></span> 
Students use software to assist with learning or complete assignment.
