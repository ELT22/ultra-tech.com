<p>Green computing:</p>
<p>This is the environmentally responsible use of computers and related 
resources. It can also be defined as the practice of efficiently and effectively 
using computers and related resources with minimal or no impact on the 
environment Advantages </p>
<p> Reduced energy usage from green computing helps lower carbon dioxide 
emissions that come from the fuel used in power plants and transportation. </p>
<p> Conserving resources means less energy is required to produce, use and 
dispose of products which are environmental friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Saving energy and resources means saving money. </p>
<p> Reduce the risk existing in the laptop such as chemical known to cause 
cancer, nerve damage and immune reactions in human. </p>
<p> Green computing also includes changing government policy to encourage 
recycling and lowering energy use by individuals and business. </p>
<p>Disadvantage </p>
<p> High start-up cost </p>
<p> Not readily available</p>
<p>&nbsp; Still experimental Green computing suggestions </p>
<p> Use computers and devices that comply with the ENERGY STAR program.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Do not leave the computer running overnight.  Turn off the monitor, 
printer, and other devices when not in use.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Use paperless methods to communicate.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Recycle paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Buy recycled paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Recycle toner cartridges. </p>
<p> Recycle old computers and printers. </p>
<p> Telecommute (saves gas). </p>
<p>Starting a computer Turn on the power button on the system Unit then turn on 
the power button of the monitor or visual display unit. Booting This is the 
process by which the computer loads system files into the main memory. This 
process involves carrying out diagnostics test. Or is the process of starting or 
restarting a computer. </p>
<p class="auto-style1">Types of booting </p>
<p>1. Cold booting. This is the starting up of the computer which has not been 
on by turning on power buttons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Warm booting This is the restarting of the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is known as system reset which can be done by processing the 
resetting button. Files and folders A file is collection related information 
that is given a name and stored so that it can be retrieved when needed. File 
names can contain two characters including spaces. A folder is a collection of 
files. A folder can also contain many sub-folders Creating a folder From the 
main option select new and then click folder. Type in the name of the new 
folder. Or Right click on the desktop From the sub menu choose New then click on 
folder By default a new folder will be created with a tittle new folder Type the 
name of the new folder and press ENTER. Renaming a folder After selecting the 
folder Select rename from the file option Or click the right button and select 
rename. Or Press F2 from the keyboard Deleting a folder Files deleted are put in 
the recycle bin. A recycle bin is a place for files no longer needed. To delete 
a file do one of the following. Select or (click on the file).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then press delete on the keyboard From the message box “Are sure you want to 
delete the folder” click OK How to retrieve deleted files Double click on 
recycle bin icon and click on file you want to retrieve. It will be restored 
back to its original location. Open the recycle Bin, Right click on the folder / 
file you want to restore. From the sub menu click on Restore Emptying the 
recycle bin Right click on the recycle Bin and then click empty recycle Bin 
Double click on the recycle bin icon on the file menu click on the empty recycle 
bin. </p>
<p class="auto-style1">HARDWARE </p>
<p>These comprises of physical, electronic, electric and mechanical components 
of a computer that help it to process data. They can also be defined as parts / 
components of a computer that are tangible and occupy space. These components 
include input devices, output devices, a system storage devices and 
communication devices. Qn: What is the difference between Computer Hardware and 
Computer Peripherals? Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a 
computer that can be touched. Computer hardware includes the essential 
mechanical, magnetic, electronic, and electrical components making up acomputer 
system While A peripheral is a device attached to a host computer but not part 
of it whose primary functionality is to expand the host’s capabilities. A 
peripheral device is not part of the system's core architecture. The 
Illustration below shows the most common hardware. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Hardware that is not part of the system unit is sometimes called a 
peripheral device or device.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;INPUT DEVICES </p>
<p>An input device is any hardware component that allows you to enter data or 
instructions into the computer Six widely used input devices are the keyboard, 
mouse, microphone, scanner, digital camera and PC video camera. Mouse. Is a 
pointing device used to manipulate on screen objects. A mouse is a small hand 
held device used for pointing. A mouse moves a pointer on the computer screen. 
It acts like a finger, allowing you to press buttons and select objects Using 
your mouse Basic parts A mouse typically has two buttons: a primary button 
(usually the left button) and a secondary button (usually the right button). The 
primary button is the one you will use most often. Most mice also include a 
scroll wheel between the buttons to help you scroll through documents and web 
pages more easily. On some mice, the scroll wheel can be pressed to act as a 
third button. Advanced mice might have additional buttons that can perform other 
functions. </p>
<p>&nbsp; Left Hand Button - Use to point and select</p>
<p>&nbsp; Right Hand Button - To open menus, commands</p>
<p>&nbsp; Using the scroll wheel</p>
<p>&nbsp; If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can use it to scroll through 
documents and web pages. To scroll down, roll the wheel backward (toward you). 
To scroll up, roll the wheel forward (away from you).</p>
<p>&nbsp; Cord - plugs mouse into computer Mouse operations Pointing Pointing 
to an item on the screen means moving your mouse so the pointer appears to be 
touching the item. When you point to something, a small box often appears that 
describes the item.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Clicking (single-clicking). To click an item, point to the item on 
the screen, and then press and release the primary button (usually the left 
button). Clicking is most often used to select (mark) an item or open a menu. 
This is sometimes called single-clicking or leftclicking.Right click to open a 
menu and to give more advanced instructions </p>
<p> Double-clicking. To double-click an item, point to the item on the screen, 
and then click twice quickly. If the two clicks are spaced too far apart, they 
might be interpreted as two individual clicks rather than as one 
double-click.Double-clicking is most often used to open items on your desktop. 
For example, you can start a program or open a folder by double-clicking its 
icon on the desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Drag. You can move items around your screen by dragging them. To drag 
an object, point to the object on the screen, press and hold the primary button, 
move the object to a new location, and then release the primary button.Dragging 
(sometimes called dragging and dropping) is most often used to move files and 
folders to a different location and to move windows and icons around on your 
screen. Tips for using your mouse safely. Holding and moving your mouse properly 
can help you avoid soreness or injury to your wrists, hands, and arms, 
particularly if you use your computer for long periods of time. Here are some 
tips to help you avoid problems: </p>
<p> Place your mouse at elbow level. Your upper arms should fall relaxed at 
your sides.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Don't squeeze or grip your mouse tightly. Hold it lightly.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Move the mouse by pivoting your arm at your elbow. Avoid bending your 
wrist up, down, or to the sides. </p>
<p> Use a light touch when clicking a mouse button. </p>
<p> Keep your fingers relaxed. Don't allow them to hover just above the 
buttons.</p>
<p>&nbsp; When you don't need to use the mouse, don't hold it. </p>
<p> Take short breaks from computer use every 15 to 20 minutes Other pointing 
devices / variants of the mouse The mouse is the most widely used pointing 
device today. Some users however, work with other pointing devices. These 
include the following. </p>
<p> Track ball. A track ball is a stationary pointing device with a ball onto 
its top. </p>
<p> Touchpad. A touchpad is a small, flat, rectangular pointing device that is 
sensitive to pressure and motion. To move the pointer using a touchpad, slide 
your fingertip across the surface of a pad. </p>
<p> Joystick and wheel. A joy stick is a vertical lever mounted on a base. You 
move the lever in different directions to control the actions of the simulated 
vehicle or players</p>
<p>&nbsp; Wheel. Is a steering wheel-type input device.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Pointer stick. A pointer stick is a pressure-sensitive pointing 
device shaped like a. pencil eraser that is positioned between keys on a 
keyboard. </p>
<p> Light pen. A light pen is a handheld input device that can detect the 
presence of light. </p>
<p> Touch screen. A touch user's screen is a touch-sensitive display device. 
Users interact with these devices by touching areas of the screens require a lot 
of arm movements. Keyboard A keyboard is an input device that contains keys 
users press to enter data into a computer. This is an input device comprising of 
alphabetical letters, numbers and other keys used to enter data into a computer. 
Many computer keyboards have got four sections. </p>
<p> Typing keys (Alphabetical key pad): Which include letters of the alphabet, 
numbers, punctuation marks, and other basic keys. </p>
<p> Numeric key pad: on the right side of the keyboard. </p>
<p> Functional Keys: which are labeled with the letter F followed by a number 
(Fl, F2F12) </p>
<p> Special keys on the keyboard</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Enter Key (Execute key). It is used to accept a command or execute a 
command. Or it is used to go to another line when typing, </p>
<p>&nbsp;2.Back space key. It is used to erase / rub characters to the left side 
of the cursor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. Space bar. It is the longest key on the keyboard and it is used to 
insert spaces between word and characters. </p>
<p>4. Caps lock. It is used to turn capital letters into small letters and small 
letters into capital letters. When the caps lock is pressed a caps lock light on 
the top right corner is turned on to indicate that you are in capital letters to 
switch to small letters press the caps lock button again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;5. Shift key. It is used to activate characters on top of the buttons, 
it can also turn in either small letters or capital letters dependin g on the 
keyboard case mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6. Delete key. It is used to erase characters on the right side of the 
cursor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;7. Fl: It is used as help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;8. Esc (escape): it is used to cancel an application under taken. 
Functions of the keyboard. Its keys allow the user to type data in form of text. 
It can be used to command the computer to perform an operation or task, It is 
the major connector between the user and the computer, Without it die user may 
not be put in the language the compute understands, Other input devices Scanner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is a light-sensing input device that reads printed text and 
graphics and translates the results into a form a computer can process Digital 
camera. It allows users to take pictures and store the photographed images 
digitally Instead of on traditional film. Web cam. This is a video camera that 
displays it's output on a web page. Joysticks. It is a pointing device with 
vertical lever for playing games. Touch Screen. A touch screen is a special kind 
of input device that allows the direct selection of a menu item or the desired 
icon with the touch of finger. Essentially, it registers the input when a finger 
or other object is touched to the screen Bar code reader. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Bar code is a machine-readable code in the form of a pattern of parallel 
vertical lines of varying widths. It is commonly used for labeling goods that 
are available in super markets and numbering&nbsp; books in libraries. This code 
is sensed and read by a bar code reader using reflective light. The information 
recorded in bar code reader is then fed into the computer, which recognizes the 
information from the thickness and spacing of bars. </p>
<p class="auto-style1">OUTPUT DEVICES</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is any type of hardware component that conveys information one or 
more people. Commonly used output devices include display devices, printers, 
speakers and headsets, fax machines and fax modems, multifunction peripheral 
data projectors e.t.c. Output is data that has been processed into useful form. 
The computer processes input (data) into information (Output). The out put, 
which can be easily understood and used by human beings, are of the following 
two forms:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Hard Copy: The physical form of output is known as hard copy. In 
general, it refers to the recorded information copied from a computer onto 
paper. Hard copy output is permanent and a relatively stable form of output. 
This type of output is also highly portable. Paper is one of the most widely 
used hard copy output media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Soft Copy: The electronic version of an output, which usually 
resides in computer memory and/or on disk, is known as soft copy. Unlike hard 
copy, soft copy is not a permanent form of output. It is transient (lasting for 
a short period of time) and is usually displayed on the screen. This kind of 
output is not tangible, that is, it cannot be touched. Soft copy output includes 
audio and visual form of output, which is generated using a computer Following 
are few of the important output devices, which are used in Computer Systems: 
Monitors Monitor commonly called as Visual Display Unit (VDU) is the main output 
device of a computer. It forms images from tiny dots, called pixels,that are 
arranged in a rectangular form. The sharpness of the image depends upon the 
number of the pixels. There are two kinds of viewing screen used for monitors:
</p>
<p> Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT). In the CRT, display is made up of small picture 
elements called pixels for short. The smaller the pixels, the better the image 
clarity or resolution. It takes more than one illuminated pixel to form whole 
character, such as the letter 'e' in the word help.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Flat-Panel Display MonitorThe flat-panel display refers to a class of 
video devices that have reduced volume, weight and power requirement compared to 
the CRT. You can hang them on walls or wear them on your wrists. Current uses 
for flat-panel displays include calculators, video games, monitors, laptop 
computer, graphics display.The flat-panel display are divided into two 
categories:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Emissive Displays - The emissive displays are devices that convert 
electrical energy into light. Example are plasma panel and LED (Light-Emitting 
Diodes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Non-Emissive Displays - The Non-emissive displays use optical 
effects to convert sunlight or light from some other source into graphics 
patterns. Example is LCD (Liquid-Crystal Device) Printers. A printer prints 
information and data from the computer onto a paper. The quality of a printer is 
determined by the clarity of a print it can produce, that is, its resolution. 
Printers are divided into two basic categories: impact printers and non-impact 
printers. As their names specify, impact printers work by physically striking a 
head or needle against an ink ribbon to make a mark on the paper. This includes 
dot matrix printers, daisy wheel printers, and drum printers. In contrast, 
inkjet and laser printers are non-impact printers. They use techniques other 
than physically striking the page to transfer ink onto the page. Factors 
considered before buying a printer </p>
<p> The number of pages per minute (ppm) the printer can print.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The memory size of the printer i.e. at least 2 MB </p>
<p> The price of the cartridge or tonner. </p>
<p> The availability of cartridge or tonner. </p>
<p> The price of the printer. </p>
<p> The purpose for which the printer is going to be put to use Advantages of 
Hard copy over soft copy </p>
<p> A hard copy can easily be accessed by both the rich and poor readers. </p>
<p> It cannot easily be changed without tracing. </p>
<p> It can be read off-line namely without a computer. </p>
<p> It is cheaper compared to softcopy, which requires computer devices to be 
able to read the information / data.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Hard copies last longer if stored in a safe place compared to 
softcopy, which must be all the time changed with the technological developments 
taking place. Speakers and headsets An audio output device is a component of a 
computer that | produces music, speech, or other sounds such as beeps. Two 
commonly used audio output devices are speakers and headsets. Many personal 
computers users add stereo speakers to their computers to generate a 
high-quality sound. Fax machines and Fax Modems A fax machine is a device that 
transmits and receives documents over telephone lines. A fax modem is a modem 
that allows you to send (and sometime receive) electronic documents as faxes 
Data projectors These are devices that take the images from a computer screen 
and projects it onto a larger screen and projects it onto a larger screen so an 
audience of people can see the image clearly. Qn1: Mention devices which can be 
classified as both input and also output computer hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Touch Screen - a touch-sensitive display device you touch words, 
pictures, numbers, letters, or locations identified on the screen. </p>
<p>2. a floppy diskette drive - a device used for both reading and writing data 
to and from a floppy disk </p>
<p>3. Optical Disk Writer - a device used for both reading and writing data to 
and from optical disks such as CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray disks</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. a hard disk drive - a device used for both reading and writing data 
to and from a Hard disk </p>
<p>5. USB flash drive - used for both reading and writing data to and from Flash 
disks </p>
<p>6. Modem STORAGE Storage holds data, instruction and information for future 
use e.g. computers can store lots and millions of customers' names and 
addresses. A computer keeps data, instructions and information on storage media 
e.g. floppy diskette, zip disk, USB flash disk, Hard disk, memory cards and 
Tapes. </p>
