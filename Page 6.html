<p>Storage devices These records (writes and records item) information to and 
from a storage media. Storage medium: also called secondary storage, is a 
physical material on which a computer keeps data, instructions, and information. 
E.g. floppy disk, Zip disk, hard disks, CDs and DVDs, tapes, PC Cards. Storage 
Capacity is the number of bytes (Characters) a storage medium can hold. Reading: 
is the process of transferring data, instructions and information from a storage 
medium into the memory. Writing: is the process of transferring items from 
memory to a storage medium. The speed of a storage media is defined by its 
access time, which is the amount of time it takes to locate an item on a storage 
medium. </p>

<p>Primary Memory (Main Memory) Primary memory holds only those data and 
instructions on which computer is currently working. It has limited capacity and 
data gets lost when power is switched off. It is generally made up of 
semiconductor device. These memories are not as fast as registers. The data and 
instructions required to be processed earlier reside in main memory. It is 
divided into two subcategories RAM and ROM. Characteristic of Main Memory&nbsp; 
These are semiconductor memories.&nbsp; It is known as main memory.&nbsp; 
Usually volatile memory.&nbsp; Data is lost in case power is switched off.&nbsp; 
It is working memory of the computer.&nbsp; Faster than secondary memories.&nbsp; 
A computer cannot run without primary memory. A RAM constitutes the internal 
memory of the CPU for storing data, program and program result. It is read/write 
memory. It is called random access memory (RAM). RAM is volatile, i.e., data 
stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power 
failure. Hence, a backup uninterruptible power system (UPS) is often used with 
computers. RAM is small, both in terms of its physical size and in the amount of 
data it can hold. ROM stands for Read Only Memory. The memory from which we can 
only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile. The 
information is stored permanently in such memories during manufacture. A ROM 
stores such instructions as are required to start computer when electricity is 
first turned on, this operation is referred to as bootstrap. ROM chip are not 
only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing 
machine and microwave oven. Secondary Memory This type of memory is also known 
as external memory or non-volatile. It is slower than main memory. These are 
used for storing Data/Information permanently. CPU directly does not access 
these memories, instead they are accessed via input-output routines. Contents of 
secondary memories are first transferred to main memory and then CPU can access 
it. For example, disk, CD-ROM, DVD, etc. Characteristics of Secondary Memory&nbsp; 
These are magnetic and optical memories.&nbsp; It is known as backup memory.&nbsp; 
It is non-volatile memory.&nbsp; Data is permanently stored even if power is 
switched off.&nbsp; It is used for storage of the data in the computer.</p>
<p class="auto-style10">2 3 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</p>

Rewritable (CD RW)&nbsp; Magnetic tape&nbsp; Photo CD Processing system unit As 
we have seen that a computer includes devices used for input, processing, 
output, storage and communication, many of these components are part of the 
system unit. The system is the case that contains electronic components of the 
computer used to process data Although many system units resemble a box, they 
are available in many shapes and sizes. The size and layout of a system unit is 
called the form factor. The case of the system unit sometimes called the 
chassis, is made of metal or plastic and protects the internal electronic 
components from damage. All computers have a system unit Components of the 
system unit includes: the processor, memory, adaptor cards, ports, bays, and 
power supply The motherboard The motherboard, sometimes called a system board, 
is the main circuit board of the system unit. Many electronic components attach 
to the mother board others are built into it. A desktop motherboard contains 
components that attach to it, including the processor, adaptor cards, memory and 
other components on i motherboard consists of one or more computer chips</p>
<p class="auto-style3">&nbsp;<span class="auto-style11">2 4 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;A computer chip is a small piece of semi-conducting material, usually 
silicon on which integrated circuits are itched. Components of the motherboard 
Processor (Central Processing Unit) The processor interprets and carries out the 
basic instructions that operate a computer. The processor significantly impacts 
the overall computing power and manages most computer operation. Central 
Processing Unit. The “brain” of the computer. It executes commands which, 
eventually, we see as a response to our input. Without the CPU, the computer is 
nothing. Processors contain the control unit, Arithmetic Logic unit and 
registers. These three components work together to perform processing operations
</p>
<p>1. The control unit: The control unit is the component of processor that 
directs and co-ordinates most of the operations in the computer. </p>
<p>2. Arithmetic Logic Unit: The Arithmetic Unit is another component of the 
processor, which performs arithmetic, comparison, and </p>
<p>3. Logic operations: Arithmetic operations include basic calculations such as 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Comparison operations 
involving comparing one data item with another to determine whether the first 
item is greater than, equal to, or less than the other. Logical Operations. 
Include conditions along with logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. Registers: The registers are devices that hold data inside the 
computer’s memory long enough to execute a particular function, such as 
indexing, calculating, sorting or otherwise manipulating data. They are the 
CPU"s own internal memory. Registers also contains high-speed storage locations 
called registers that temporarily hold data and instructions. Registers are part 
of the processor not part of memory or storage. Heat sink and heat pipes. </p>
<p class="auto-style10">2 5 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</p>
<p>&nbsp;Although the computer's main fan generates airflow, today's processors 
require additional cooling. Heat sink: It absorbs and ventilates heat produced 
by electronic components such as processor. Heat pipes: These cools processors 
in notebook computers Memory This holds data waiting to be processed and 
instructions waiting to be executed. And memory is usually part or are connect 
to the main circuit board called mother board. Expansion slots An expansion slot 
is a socket on the motherboard that can hold an adaptor card. Adaptor cards An 
adaptor card sometimes called an expansion card is a circuit board that enhances 
functions of a component of the system unit and /or provides connections to 
peripheral. Ports and connections A computer port is a physical docking point 
using which an external device can be connected to the computer. A computer port 
can also be programmatic docking point through which information flows from a 
program to computer or over the internet. External devices are connected to a 
computer using cables and ports. Ports are slots on the motherboard into which a 
cable of external device is plugged in. Examples of external devices attached 
via ports are mouse, keyboard, monitor, microphone , speakers, etc. </p>
<p class="auto-style10">2 6 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</p>
<p>&nbsp;Following are few important types of ports: Serial Port Used for 
external modems and older computer mouse. Two versions: 9 pin, 25 pin model. 
Data travels at 115 kilobits per second. Parallel Port Used for scanners and 
printers Also called printer port. 25 pin model. Also known as IEEE 
1284-compliant Centronics port. </p>
<p class="auto-style10">2 7 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</p>
<p>&nbsp;PS/2 Port Used for old computer keyboard and mouse Also called mouse 
port. Most of the old computers provide two PS/2 ports, each for mouse and 
keyboard. Also known as IEEE 1284-compliant Centronics port. Universal Serial 
Bus (or USB) Port Can connect all kinds of external USB devices such as external 
hard disk, printer, scanner, mouse, keyboard, etc. Introduced in 1997. Most of 
the computers provide two USB ports as minimum. Data travels at 12 megabits per 
second. USB compliant devices can get power from a USB port. VGA Port Connects 
monitor to a computer's video card. Has 15 holes. Similar to serial port 
connector but serial port connector has pins, it has holes. Power Connector 
Three-pronged plug Connects to the computer's power cable that plugs into a 
power bar or wall socket. Firewire Port Transfer large amounts of data at very 
fast speed. Connects camcorders and video equipments to the computer Data 
travels at 400 to 800 megabits per second. Invented by Apple Modem Connects a 
PC's modem to the telephone network. Ethernet Port Connects to a network and 
high speed Internet. Connects network cable to a computer. This port resides on 
an Ethernet Card. Data travels at 10 megabits to 1000 megabits per second 
depending upon the network bandwidth.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">&nbsp;<span class="auto-style11">2 8 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Game Port Connect a PC to a joystick. Now replaced by USB. Digital 
Video Interface, DVI port Connects a Flat panel LCD monitor to the computer's 
high-end video graphic cards. Very popular among video card manufacturers. 
Sockets Connect microphone, speakers to sound card of the computer Hardware 
represents the physical and tangible components of the computer, i.e., the 
components that can be seen and touched. Some motherboards include all necessary 
capabilities and do not require adaptor cards e.g. sound and video functions may 
be built in a newer motherboard. Other motherboards may require adaptor cards to 
provide sound, video, modem and network capabilities. A sound card enhances the 
sound generating capabilities of a personal computer by allowing sound to be 
input through microphone and output through external speakers and headsets. A 
video card also called a graphic card converts computer output into a video 
signal that travels through a cable to monitor which displays an image on the 
screen. A network card (RJ45) is a communication device that allows computers to 
access a network. In the past installing a card was not easy and required you to 
set switches and other elements on the motherboard. Many of today's computers 
support Plug and Play where a computer automatically configures adaptor cards 
and other peripheral as you install them. Having a plug and play support means 
you can plug in a device, turn on the computer, and then immediately begin using 
them. </p>
<p class="auto-style4">PORTS AND CONNECTIONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;A port is the point at which a peripheral attaches to the system unit 
so as it can send data and receive information from the computer. A connector 
joins a cable to the peripheral. Most computers have atleast one serial port, 
one parallel port, and four USB ports. Serial Ports (Male port) A serial port is 
a type of interface that connects a device to the system unit by transmitting 1 
bit of data at a time. Serial ports usually connect devices that do not require 
faster data transmission e.g. monitor keyboard, or modem Parallel Port. (Female 
port)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span class="auto-style10">2 9 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;A parallel port is an interface that connects devices by transferring 
more than 1 bit of data a time. Parallel ports were developed as an alternate to 
the slower speed serial ports. They connect devices such as printers. USB ports 
USB ports can connect up to 127 different peripherals together with a single 
connector type. Personal computers typically have four to eight USB ports either 
on the front or back of the system unit. A USB hub is a device that plugs into a 
USB port on the system unit and contains multiple USB ports into which you plug 
cables from USB devices.</p>
<p class="auto-style5">&nbsp;<span class="auto-style4">SOFTWARE</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Software is a set of instructions that drive a computer to perform 
specific tasks. These instructions tell the machine’s physical components what 
to do. A set of instructions is often called a program. When a computer is using 
a particular program, it is said to be running or executing the program. The two 
most common types of programs are system software and application software.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">&nbsp;<span class="auto-style11">3 0 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</span></p>
<p class="auto-style4">TYPES OF SOFTWARE</p>
<p>&nbsp;Computer software is broadly divided into two categories namely:&nbsp; 
System software&nbsp; Application software System Software. This consists of 
programs that control or manage the operation of the computer and its devices. 
System software serves as an interface between users, the application its 
software and the computer's hard ware. System software is computer software 
designed to operate the computer hardware and to provide maintain a platform for 
running application software. Examples of system software include;&nbsp; The 
operating system&nbsp; Utility Programs&nbsp; Programming language.</p>
<p class="auto-style4">&nbsp;OPERATING SYSTEM</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is a set of programs containing instructions that co-ordinate all 
the activities among hardware resources.&nbsp; In otherwords, an operating 
system is a computer’s master control program.&nbsp; It provides a user with the 
tools (commands) that enable him/her interact with the computer.&nbsp; It also 
acts as a primary controlling mechanism for the computers hardware.&nbsp; 
Without an operating system, a user cannot run an application program on their 
computer. Classification of operating system Real-Time operating Systems:&nbsp; 
Refers to multitasking operating system that aims at executing real-time 
applications.&nbsp; A real time application is an application that responds to 
certain inputs extremely quickly.&nbsp; Very fast and relatively small operating 
systems.&nbsp; Built into a device, not loaded from a disk drive.&nbsp; Used in 
MP3 players, Medical devices such as medical diagnostics equipment, life-support 
systems etc. </p>
<p class="auto-style10">3 1 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</p>
<p>&nbsp;Single-User/Single-Tasking Operating Systems:&nbsp; Allows a single 
user to perform just one task at a time&nbsp; Take up little space on disk&nbsp; 
Run on inexpensive computers&nbsp; Examples include; MS-DOS and Palm OS for palm 
handheld computers. Single-User/Multi-Tasking Operating Systems:&nbsp; Allows a 
single user to perform two or more functions at once.&nbsp; Commonly used on 
personal computers.&nbsp; Examples include; Microsoft Windows and MAC OS. 
Multi-User/Multitasking Operating Systems:&nbsp; Allows multiple users to use 
programs that are simultaneously running on a single network server.&nbsp; Here, 
each user is given a user session on the server.&nbsp; UNIX, Linux are examples.&nbsp; 
Maintenance can be easy.&nbsp; Requires a powerful computer. </p>
<p class="auto-style4">FUNCTIONS OF OPERATING SYSTEM </p>
<p>&nbsp;The operating system manages the computer devices (Device manager)&nbsp; 
It conducts the process of booting or starting the computer (starting a 
computer)&nbsp; It acts as a file manager (file management):Operating systems 
often provide users with the capability of managing files, viewing graphics 
files, uninstalling programs, scanning disks. It acts as an interface between 
the computer and the user(providing a User interface) It provides the means for 
proper user of the resources like monitor, memory, input and output devices,&nbsp; 
It interprets the program instructions one at a time (managing programs): </p>
<p>&nbsp;Some operating systems support only one running program at a time 
others support thousands of users running multiple programs.&nbsp; It loads the 
user program into the memory. It gives instruction to display the results on the 
monitor.&nbsp; It also manages me printing process: me operating system 
determines the order in which jobs are processed. A job is an operation that the 
processor manages. · Memory management: the purpose of memory management is to 
optimize the use of Random Access Memory.The operating systems allocates, 
assigns data and instructions to an area of the memory while they are being 
processed.&nbsp; Configuring Devices: A driver is a small program that tells the 
operating system how to communicate with a specific device. When you boot the 
computer, the operating system loads each device's driver. These devices will 
not function without their correct drivers.&nbsp; Controlling a network: Some 
operating systems are network operating systems.A network OS is an operating 
system that organizes and coordinates how multiple users access and share&nbsp; 
resources on a network resources including hardware, software, data and 
information. It has more security features than other OS. Examples of operating 
system:</p>

<p class="auto-style4">TYPES OF USER INTERFACE</p>
<p>&nbsp;The two most common types of user interfaces are graphical and command 
line. </p>
<p class="auto-style4">GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI)</p>
<p>&nbsp;These are interfaces which use icons, small pictures and viewable 
images to issue commands. You are provided with a coloured screen with lines 
(bars) each representing a program and a mouse. Graphical user Interfaces (GUI): 
Most common interface used in versions of; Windows, MAC OS, in some versions of
</p>
<p>LINUX and UNIX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Uses a mouse to work with graphical objects such as windows, menus, 
icons, buttons and other tools.</p>
<p><span class="auto-style11">&nbsp;</span><span class="auto-style10">3 3 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Can use Shortcuts to open programs or documents. It enables task 
switching. Advantage: It frees a computer user from memorizing and typing text 
commands.</p>
<p class="auto-style10">&nbsp;3 4 | ©&nbsp; ULTRA TECH 2024</p>
<p>WindowsdS </p>
<p class="auto-style4">COMMAND LINE USER INTERFACE</p>
<p>&nbsp;These are interface where commands are issued by typing special keys on 
the keyboard, a user is provided by a blank screen with a blinking cursor called 
a prompt. Example includes DOS, Linux. 2) Command Line Interface Older interface 
used in MS-DOS, Linux, UNIX User types commands at a prompt to execute tasks. 
User must remember all commands. Windows also has an optional command prompt 
that can be used by administrators to run non-GUI programs for managing and 
troubleshooting windows. </p>

INTERFACES &amp; COMMAND LINE WINDOWS (GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE</p>
<p>&nbsp;Interface takes up little memory and doesn't require very fast 
processor. Needs or requires more memory as well as a faster processor. 
Operation is fast because commands can be entered directly through the keyboard 
Operation on the windows environment depends on the powerfulness of the 
processor. Many commands can be grouped together as a batch file so that 
repetition task can be automated. It is difficult to automate functions for 
expert users. Commands can be learnt Graphical user interface is a user friendly 
because it is easy to learn and work with. Commands have to be memorized 
Commands do not need to be memorized because the commands are represented with 
icons and pictures. </p>
<p class="auto-style10">3 6 | ©&nbsp; ULTRA TECH 2024</p>
<p>&nbsp;Utility program A utility program is a type of system software that 
performs specific task usually related to managing a computer its devices or its 
programs. Utility software: Utility software is a kind of system software 
designed to help analyses, configure, optimize and maintain the computer Most 
operating systems include several utility programs, Utility programs 
Defragmenting Utility Anti-virus Utility Time Utility Date Utility Copying.</p>
<p class="auto-style4">&nbsp;APPLICATION SOFTWARE</p>
<p>. It consists of programs that perform specific tasks to a user. Application 
software is used for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; As a business tool.&nbsp; To 
assist with graphics and multimedia projects&nbsp; To support home, personal, 
and educational activities.&nbsp; To facilitate communication Most application 
software are available as packed software that can be purchased in a software 
shop or the web. Application software is available of forms. i.e. packages 
(off-shelf) custom, shareware, freeware and public domain. Packaged software 
(off-shelf) This is a mass produced, copy written retail software that meets the 
needs of wide variety of users not just a single user or company. Application 
software are available in general nature Custom software</p>
<p class="auto-style10">&nbsp;3 7 | © ULTRA TECH 2024</p>
<p>&nbsp;These are software designed to meet the needs of a particular 
organization or user (consumer) and performs function specific for the business 
or industry. Sometimes the company cannot find package software that meets its 
requirement so it orders for a custom software Shareware This is a copy written 
software that it is distributed free for a trial period To use a share ware 
program beyond that period you send the payment to the person or a company that 
developed that program Free ware This software is provided at no cost to a user 
by an individual or a company Public ware Is an application software that is 
designed for the public. Starting and interacting with an application software 
To use application software you must instruct the operating system to start the 
program </p>
